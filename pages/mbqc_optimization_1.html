          Quantum computing developed out of the realization that decreasing transistor sizes were quickly approaching physical limitations. Quantum computing surpasses these limitations by using subatomic particles to store information. These particles are termed qubits, and exist in a superposition of two states, 0 or 1. The state of a qubit is only determined when it is measured, as it is so delicate that performing the measurement causes the qubit’s superposition to collapse to a single value. Gate-model quantum circuits were the first implementation of quantum computing, and are similar to traditional computing circuits. However, this implementation does not really take into account the properties of quantum circuits. Measurement-based quantum computing, or MBQC for short, takes a different approach. Measurements, rather than gates, are performed on a cluster state of qubits to implement quantum computations. Since MBQC is a relatively new method of quantum computing, there is significant potential for optimizing the compilers that map quantum circuits to desired hardware, such as photon clusters (Li et al., 2023). This research explores the optimization potential of ZX-calculus, a circuit diagramming language, and lays out an end-to-end method of applying ZX-calculus to MBQC.

          To optimize a measurement-based quantum circuit with ZX-calculus, a quantum circuit must first be in measurement pattern form. Measurement patterns require an entangled set of qubits upon which measurements are applied. Converting an initial circuit from gate-model form to this entangled resource state is straightforward and based on the equivalence of quantum gates to measurement patterns. The universal quantum gate set consists of fundamental quantum gates that can be used to construct more complex gates. The universal quantum gate set consists of the X, Y, Z, H, and CNOT gate (Vazirani, 2018). The effect of applying the single-qubit gates X, Y, Z, and H, can be conceptualized as rotations of the qubit along the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a standard three-axis, three-dimensional sphere, except the positive Z axis represents the 0 state, the negative Z axis represents the 1 state, and the X axis represents an equal superposition of the 0 and 1 state (Vazirani, 2018).

          The universal quantum gate set can be represented by the set U, where U = {J(α), ∧Z}. J(α) is a rotation of angle α, and ∧Z is the two-qubit entangling CNOT gate (Broadbent & Kashefi, 2007). The elements in the set U are equivalent to the MBQC measurement patterns described by the equations below.

Vertices are then contracted and labeled, with input qubits being represented by a boxed vertex and output qubits represented by a white vertex in the final graph. The black qubits in the final graph are measured with the labeled angles (Broadbent & Kashefi, 2007).

          After the entangled resource state is created, a single-qubit gate can be implemented as a single-qubit measurement by expanding upon the concept of single-qubit teleportation.

            Fig 3. The gate-model implementation of fundamental quantum teleportation is shown as the initial circuit state. Certain gates are then replaced and measurement operations are applied to create an entangled state. Measuring this entangled gate as specified corresponds to the application of the single-qubit gate HZ(α). To complete the implementation of any arbitrary rotation P(θ), this process can be concatenated three times to create the final measurement sequence displayed by the final circuit diagram (Kok, 2010).

The spiders are pulled through the unextracted section to the extracted selection by working with the biadjacency matrix and applying the corresponding row operations to the diagram. This process is repeated until only input spiders are left in the unextracted section. The extracted section is now in a circuit-like form and can be directly converted to a circuit by replacing equivalent components (Staudacher, 2021).

          The application of ZX-calculus to measurement-based quantum circuits is straightforward, and has significant optimization potential for compilers that map quantum circuits to computational hardware (Li et al., 2023). Working towards the optimization of real-world circuits with ZX-calculus, researchers are implementing ZX-diagram simplification with code and testing it on quantum circuits that implement computing problems from fields such as chemistry, machine learning, and cryptography (Staudacher, 2021). There is also significant potential for extending the ZX-calculus method, as it can be guided by heuristics such as maximizing the resultant number of Hadamard wires (Staudacher, 2021).
