                to technology, especially microcontrollers, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing.

              <div class = "text">My first language was Java, which introduced me to programming
                and data structures, but Python is the language that allowed me to delve into things like 
                machine learning, image manipulation, and games. Through the years, I have also become familiar with web
                development frameworks, Google Firebase, and Figma.

              work on a data platform and it's large language model applications. I am extremely 
              grateful for the opportunity to continue working part-time through this upcoming school year. I am also working on a summer research project
              on the optimization of measurement-based quantum circuits, funded by the William & Mary Monroe Scholar program.

              with family and friends. I also enjoy traveling and being outside.
